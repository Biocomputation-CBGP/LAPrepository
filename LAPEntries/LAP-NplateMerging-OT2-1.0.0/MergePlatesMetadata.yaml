Script: 
 name: ScriptMergePlates.py
 title: Colony N-plates Merging
 version: 1.0.0
 description: >
  Sample transfer from 1 or more plates to less plates. This selection of samples is established and the
  objective is to compact a number of plates in less final plates.
  As well, these samples can be inoculated with 1 media as well

Comments: >
 This protocol can only work with single-channel pipettes,
 the required packages need to be installed and the input file
 need to be in the robot that is going to run this script
