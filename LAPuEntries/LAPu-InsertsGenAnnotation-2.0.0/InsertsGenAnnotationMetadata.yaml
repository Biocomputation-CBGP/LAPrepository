Input:
 minNumerArguments: 4
 directoryReads:
  description: path to the directory with all the sequence that are going to be allign with the genome and also the quality files with those sequences if neccessary
  value: path
 extensionReads: 
  description: value that will correspond to the extension of the reads that are going to be in the folder established in the argument directoryReads
  value: string 
 genomeSequence:
  description: file that contains the sequence of the genome that the sequences in directoryReads are going to be allign 
  extension: FASTA
 genomeAnnotation:
  description: file that contains the description and annotation of the genome in genomeSequence in a table format
  extension: CSV
Output:
 minNumberOutputFiles: 3
 value: directory by default called results_script_blast with at least 3 files
 all_reads_merged.fasta: FASTA file with all the sequences in the directoryReads joined one after another
 all_seq_aligned.tsv: TSV file with the output given by BLASTn of alligning all_reads_merged.fasta with the file genomeSequence 
 table_reads_genes_description.csv: CSV file with a table where the hits between the allignments of the sequences in directoryReads and the Locus in the genomeAnnotation file are shown, between other data associated to both the allignment and annotation
